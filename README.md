# Python for Astronomers

This repository contains notebooks and class materials for an introductory
course in computing for astromnomy presented by [Westminster Astronomical
Society](https://www.westminsterastro.org/). It is intended as an introduction
to programing with an emphasis on Python.

Python is a high-level, open-source, scripting language that is relatively easy
to understand. It has a wide user base in the scientific community and an
extensice collection third-party packages for scientific applications,
paricularly in astronomy. This makes it ideal for our purpose.

It is not intended as an introduction to astronomy but many of the examples will
be astronomy related so familiarity with the terms and concepts of astronomy is
helpful but not required.

The course material is written primarily in Jupyter notebooks. Project Jupyter
is a collecton of applications that provide an interactive interface to the
Python shell and many other scripting languages. It includes console
applications, graphical user interfaces and widgets for display of data. The
Jupyter noteboob is a browser based graphical interface. It allows you to
include formatted text, images, mathematical equations and other visualizatons
alongside the code.  [Jupyter documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/)

## Using the notebooks

To download and run these notebooks:

1. Click the green **code** button and select "Download ZIP"
2. Clone the repository to your local machine: copy the url and in a terminal run:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Westminster-Astronomical-Society/Python-for-astronomers.git`
3. To get updates in the terminal cd into Python-for-astronomers and run:  
   `git pull`

**Note:** You may wish to fork the repository to your own account  and clone it if you plan to make changes to the documents. You can then submit a pull request to incorporate them into the upstream repo.

## Installing Python / Jupyter on your computer

You will need Python, Jupyter and several other third-party packages to run the notebooks. The easiest way to get all of them is to install the Anaconda Python distribution. Download and run the installer for your system.

- Anaconda Python distribution: [www.anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/)
